## Migration Considerations

### 1. Technology Migration
```python
class MigrationPlan:
    def __init__(self):
        self.steps = []
        self.validations = []
        self.rollbacks = []
        
    def add_step(self, step: MigrationStep):
        self.steps.append(step)
        self.validations.append(step.validation)
        self.rollbacks.append(step.rollback)
```

### 2. Risk Assessment
```python
class MigrationRisk:
    def __init__(self):
        self.risks = {
            "technical": self.assess_technical_risk(),
            "business": self.assess_business_risk(),
            "timeline": self.assess_timeline_risk()
        }
        
    def assess_technical_risk(self):
        return self.evaluate_complexity() * self.evaluate_impact()
```

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Resource Usage
```python
class ResourceProfile:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = {
            "cpu_usage": self.measure_cpu(),
            "memory_usage": self.measure_memory(),
            "disk_usage": self.measure_disk()
        }
        
    def evaluate_efficiency(self):
        return sum(self.metrics.values()) / len(self.metrics)
```

### 2. Optimization Opportunities
```python
class PerformanceOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.optimizations = {
            "caching": self.optimize_caching,
            "async": self.optimize_async,
            "batching": self.optimize_batching
        }
        
    def apply_optimizations(self):
        return [opt() for opt in self.optimizations.values()]
```

## Security Assessment

### 1. Security Features
```python
class SecurityProfile:
    def __init__(self):
        self.features = {
            "authentication": self.assess_auth(),
            "encryption": self.assess_encryption(),
            "access_control": self.assess_access()
        }
        
    def calculate_security_score(self):
        return sum(self.features.values()) / len(self.features)
```

### 2. Vulnerability Analysis
```python
class VulnerabilityScanner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scanners = {
            "code": CodeScanner(),
            "dependency": DependencyScanner(),
            "configuration": ConfigScanner()
        }
        
    def scan_all(self):
        return {name: scanner.scan() 
                for name, scanner in self.scanners.items()}
