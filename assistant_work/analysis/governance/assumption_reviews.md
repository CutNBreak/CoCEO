## Validation Process
Each assumption is validated through:
1. Code analysis
2. Documentation review
3. Test execution (where applicable)
4. Dependency analysis

## Review Schedule
- Review assumptions after completing each chunk analysis
- Update status and findings based on new evidence
- Add new assumptions as they emerge during analysis

## Status Definitions
- **Initial**: First documentation of assumption
- **Unverified**: Documented but not yet validated
- **Partially Verified**: Some evidence supports the assumption
- **✓ Verified**: Fully validated with clear evidence
- **Incorrect**: Found to be false
- **Updated**: Modified based on new information

## Next Steps
1. Begin validating assumptions about remaining tools through Chunk 3 analysis
2. Document any new assumptions discovered during analysis
3. Update status of existing assumptions as evidence is found

## Change Log
- Initial creation: Documented first set of assumptions based on project structure
- First Update: Validated core system assumptions after Chunk 1 analysis
- Second Update: Validated computer system and language implementation assumptions after Chunk 2 analysis
- Added execution model and resource management assumptions
- Updated security and performance assumptions
