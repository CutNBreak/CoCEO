# Chunking Strategy for Codebase Analysis

## Strategy Overview
The codebase will be analyzed in logical chunks, focusing on related functionality and following the natural architecture of the system. This approach ensures thorough understanding while maintaining context and discovering relationships between components.

## Chunk Definitions

### Chunk 1: Core System Foundation
**Focus**: Core system architecture and base functionality
**Files**:
- `interpreter/core/__init__.py`
- `interpreter/core/core.py`
- `interpreter/core/async_core.py`
- `interpreter/core/respond.py`
- `interpreter/core/render_message.py`
- `interpreter/core/default_system_message.py`

**Rationale**: Understanding the core system is crucial as it forms the foundation for all other functionality.

### Chunk 2: LLM Integration
**Focus**: Language model integration and management
**Files**:
- `interpreter/core/llm/`
  - All files in this directory

**Rationale**: LLM integration is a critical component that drives the system's intelligence.

### Chunk 3: Computer Control System
**Focus**: Computer interaction and control
**Files**:
- `interpreter/core/computer/`
  - All subdirectories and files

**Rationale**: The computer control system represents the main interaction layer with the operating system.

### Chunk 4: Tool Management
**Focus**: Tool implementation and management
**Files**:
- `interpreter/computer_use/tools/`
  - All files in this directory

**Rationale**: Tools are the primary way the system interacts with the computer, making this a crucial component.

### Chunk 5: Terminal Interface
**Focus**: User interaction and terminal UI
**Files**:
- `interpreter/terminal_interface/`
  - Core interface files
  - Components directory
  - Utils directory

**Rationale**: Understanding how users interact with the system is essential for maintaining and improving the interface.

### Chunk 6: Configuration and Profiles
**Focus**: System configuration and user profiles
**Files**:
- `interpreter/terminal_interface/profiles/`
- Configuration-related files across the project

**Rationale**: Configuration management affects all aspects of the system's behavior.

### Chunk 7: Examples and Documentation
**Focus**: Usage patterns and documentation
**Files**:
- `examples/`
- `docs/`

**Rationale**: Examples and documentation provide insights into intended usage and implementation patterns.

## Analysis Approach for Each Chunk

1. **Initial Survey**
   - List all files in the chunk
   - Identify key classes and functions
   - Note dependencies and imports

2. **Deep Dive**
   - Analyze implementation details
   - Document patterns and architectural decisions
   - Map relationships with other chunks

3. **Documentation**
   - Create detailed summary in `analysis/codebase/chunkX_summary.md`
   - Update dependency maps and architectural insights
   - Note potential improvements or concerns

4. **Validation**
   - Cross-reference with other chunks
   - Verify assumptions about interactions
   - Document any questions or uncertainties

## Excluded from Deep Analysis
- Auto-generated files
- External dependencies
- Cache directories
- Build artifacts

## Priority Order
1. Chunk 1 (Core System)
2. Chunk 2 (LLM Integration)
3. Chunk 3 (Computer Control)
4. Chunk 4 (Tool Management)
5. Chunk 5 (Terminal Interface)
6. Chunk 6 (Configuration)
7. Chunk 7 (Examples/Docs)

## Adjustment Strategy
This chunking strategy may be adjusted based on:
- Discoveries during analysis
- User requirements or priorities
- Dependencies between components
- Emerging patterns or concerns

## Progress Tracking
Progress for each chunk will be tracked in:
- `analysis/codebase/` directory
- `impact_log.md`
- `current_tasks.yaml`

## Next Steps
1. Begin analysis of Chunk 1 (Core System)
2. Create initial chunk summary document
3. Map core dependencies and patterns
4. Update strategy based on findings

This strategy will be reviewed and updated as our understanding of the codebase deepens.
